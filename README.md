See documentation and working examples here http://jquery-mosaic.tin.cat

A jQuery plugin by Tin.cat that builds responsive mosaics of images or any other content fitted to match heights in multiple rows while maintaining aspect ratios.

Works wonderfully with images by creating a visually ordered and pleasant mosaic (much like mosaics on Flickr, 500px and Google+) without gaps between elements, but at the same time respecting aspect ratios. Reacts to window resizes and adapts responsively to any screen size.

Here's a bonus (NSFW) working site using jQuery mosaic: https://skinography.net
